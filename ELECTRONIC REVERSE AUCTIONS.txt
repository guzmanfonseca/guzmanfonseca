5. The procuring entity shall suspend or terminate the auction in the case of failures in its communication system that put at risk the proper conduct of the auction or for other reasons stipulated in the rules for the conduct of the auction. The procuring entity shall not disclose the identity of any bidder in the case of suspension or termination of the auction.

Article 57. Requirements after the electronic reverse auction 

1. The bid that at the closure of the electronic reverse auction is the lowest-priced bid or the most advantageous bid, as applicable, shall be the successful bid.

2. In procurement by means of an auction that was not preceded by examination 
or evaluation of initial bids, the procuring entity shall ascertain after
the auction the responsiveness of the successful bid and the qualifications of
the supplier or contractor submitting it. The procuring entity shall reject that
bid if it is found to be unresponsive or if the supplier or contractor submitting
it is found unqualified. Without prejudice to the right of the procuring entity
to cancel the procurement in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 19 of this
Law, the procuring entity shall select the bid that was the next lowest-priced
or next most advantageous bid at the closure of the auction, provided that that
bid is ascertained to be responsive and the supplier or contractor submitting it
is ascertained to be qualified.

3. Where the successful bid at the closure of the auction appears to the
procuring entity to be abnormally low and gives rise to concerns on the part of
the procuring entity as to the ability of the bidder that presented it to perform
the procurement contract, the procuring entity may follow the procedures
described in article 20 of this Law. If the procuring entity rejects the bid as
abnormally low under article 20, it shall select the bid that at the closure of
the auction was the next lowest-priced or next most advantageous bid. This
provision is without prejudice to the right of the procuring entity to cancel the
procurement in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 19 of this Law.
